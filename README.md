Life-Expectancy-GDP
=======================
**Project Overview**

Analysis of data on GDP and life expectancy from the World Health Organization and the World Bank to try and identify the relationship between the GDP and life expectancy of six countries.

Results Summary
=======================
* There is a linear assocation of .343 between GDP and Life Expectancy. Generally, a correlation larger than about .3 indicates a linear association. A correlation greater than about .6 suggestions a strong linear association.

**Additional Findings:**

* The United States of America's GDP was 75.73% larger in 2015, relative to what it was in 2000.

* China's GDP was 813.42% larger in 2015, relative to what it was in 2000.

* The entire dataset has life expectancy median of 76.65 and a mean GDP of 3,880,498,570,768.39

* Between 2000 and 2015, Zimbabwe's life expectancy rate increased by: 31.96%, while the country's GDP was 143.72% larger in 2015, relative to what it was in 2000.

* Between 2000 and 2015, life expectancies in The United States of America, Mexico, Germany, China, and Chile increased at a combined average rate of: 4.38%.

Process
=======================


**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
 * Establish the question(s) we are trying to solve
 * What kind of data do we have? What types of visualizations suit our types?
 * What's missing from the data? (if anything)
 * Where are the outliers?
 * How can we add, change or remove features to get more out of the data?

**Questions Formulated From EDA**

 * Has life expectancy increased over time in the six nations?
 * Has GDP increased over time in the six nations?
 * What is the average life expectancy in these nations?
 * Is there a correlation between GDP and life expectancy of a country?
