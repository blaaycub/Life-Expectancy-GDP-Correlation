# Life-Expectancy-GDP

**Project Overview**
For this project, I will analyze data on GDP and life expectancy from the World Health Organization and the World Bank to try and identify the relationship between the GDP and life expectancy of six countries.

**Project Goals:**
Conduct an exploratory data analysis:
 * Establish the question we are trying to solve
 * What kind of data do we have? What types of visualizations suit our types?
 * What's missing from the data? (if anything)
 * Where are the outliers?
 * How can we add, change or remove features to get more out of the data?

Questions to gain insight

 * Has life expectancy increased over time in the six nations?
 * Has GDP increased over time in the six nations?
 * What is the average life expectancy in these nations?
 * Is there a correlation between GDP and life expectancy of a country?
